The new Kootenai County law building is more than just a physical structure—it’s a glaring symbol of the systemic corruption that plagues the North Idaho legal system, particularly among judges and lawyers. While Idaho often prides itself on being a conservative stronghold, the reality is far from it. The actions of its leaders and legal officials tell a very different story—one of hypocrisy, waste, and self-enrichment at the expense of taxpayers.  

# COVID-19 Funds Misused for a Needless Expansion  

During the COVID-19 pandemic, while countless Americans were struggling financially and confined to their homes, the Biden administration rolled out a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 stimulus package. Not a single Republican voted for this package, yet Idaho—supposedly a bastion of conservative values—had no qualms about cashing in. In my view, this is a prime example of the legal system’s primary function: to enrich itself. Idaho diverted $22 million in COVID-19 relief funds to finance an expansion of their law campus, dubbed the "justice building." Let’s be clear: this project had no legitimate connection to pandemic relief. Instead, it was a blatant misuse of taxpayer money. 

> Predictably, the project’s budget ballooned from $22 million in 2022 to over [$65 million](https://kootenaijournal.com/2023/12/11/justice-center/), triple the original budget, from April 2022 to December 2023. Inflation peaked in 2022, so what's their explanation?

This is clear corruption and waste, with the Board of County Commissioners, judges, politicians, contractors, and lawyers lining their pockets while ordinary citizens foot the bill for a totally unncessary and wasteful project.  

# Judge Cynthia Meyer and the "COVID Backlog" Justification  

One of the most egregious aspects of this project is the justification provided by Judge Cynthia Meyer and others. She claimed the expansion was necessary to address a "COVID backlog." This rationale is nothing short of fraudulent. By this logic, virtually any expense could be tied to the pandemic, highlighting the unchecked power of judges, politicians, and lawyers to manipulate definitions to suit their agendas.  

The Kootenai County legal system is already widely perceived as corrupt. Instead of holding judges accountable—some of whom, in my view, belong in jail—they’re being rewarded with a shiny new building funded by taxpayers. This is not conservatism; it’s cronyism.  

# Hypocrisy and Fiscal Irresponsibility  

Idaho’s leaders love to tout their conservative credentials, but their actions tell a different story. Kootenai County has been more aggressive in seeking federal handouts than many liberal states. Idaho, like other so-called "conservative" states, receives more federal funding than it contributes. This hypocrisy is staggering, especially when compared to neighboring Washington State, which contributes more in federal taxes than it receives.  

The $22 million spent on the "justice building" didn’t just come out of thin air—it fueled inflation, driving up costs for everyone. Yet, will Kootenai County admit this? Of course not. They’ll blame Joe Biden, despite the fact that they profited just as much as any liberal city.  

# A Legal System in Need of Accountability, Not Expansion  

In my view, the Kootenai County legal system doesn’t need a new building—it needs to be downsized and held accountable. The existing system is rife with corruption, and expanding it only perpetuates the problem. Instead of addressing the abuses of power within the judiciary, we’re giving them a new playground to continue their misconduct.  

The federal government should demand that Idaho return the misallocated funds. The "justice building" had no legitimate connection to COVID-19 relief, and its construction was a misuse of government aid. This project is a slap in the face to taxpayers and a betrayal of the conservative principles Idaho claims to uphold.  

# Conclusion  

The Kootenai County "justice building" is, in my opinion, a monument to corruption, fiscal irresponsibility, and hypocrisy. It’s a reminder that the legal system often exists to serve itself, not the people. Idaho’s leaders may talk a big game about conservatism, but their actions reveal a very different truth. Until we hold judges, lawyers, and politicians accountable, this cycle of waste and abuse will continue. The "justice building" isn’t just a building—it’s a symbol of everything that’s wrong with our legal system.

description: The corruption of the family law system in Kootenai County Idaho

> Corruption is not confined to the halls of justice; it seeps into every hand that feeds it, every voice that defends it, and every system that enables it. The rot is not in the tree alone, but in the roots and the soil that sustain it.

This is a criticism of the entire family law system in Kootenai County. This is a criticism of:

- Kootenai County Magistrate Court
- Family Court Service Office (supervised visitation, parenting class)
- Mediation

These are topics I want to add later:

- Idaho Department of Health and Welfare
- Judges
- Attorneys and Idaho Bar
- "Best Interest Standard"
- Pediatricians and social workers
- Coeur d'Alene PD
- Women's shelters (e.g. Safe Passage)
- Guardian ad Litems
- Custody Evaluators
- Child Support Enforcement

Ultimately, this is the fault of the government for having such a corrupt system that does nothing but harm children and good parents, while lining their own pockets, abusing power, and attacking those who try to hold this system accountable.
